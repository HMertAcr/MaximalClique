# MaximalClique

## To Do

* Change the creation of adjacency list to not bruteforce finding adjacencies (tried to do it but it was slower)
* MAKE FASTER!!!
* changed std::unordered_set to std::vector in adjacency list it causes a lot of overhead check others
* decide if unordered_set or vector is better for containing cliques in algorithms
