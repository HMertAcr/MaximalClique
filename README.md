# MaximalClique

## To Do

* Create adjacency list
  * function to create full list in one pass
  * or function to create list for a given node
* Use adjacency list to optimize
  * checkClique
  * checkMaximalClique by finding the intersection of the adjacency lists of the nodes in the clique
* delete approximate and replace it with lexigraphicalBFS
